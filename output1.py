WARNING:tensorflow:From C:\Users\hans\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\site-packages\tflearn\initializations.py:119: UniformUnitScaling.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.init_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use tf.initializers.variance_scaling instead with distribution=uniform to get equivalent behavior.
